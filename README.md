## Abstract
During software maintenance, bug reports are a crucial source of information for developers—but such reports often contain long and complex discussions, making it hard to identify the key information. Existing summarization methods tend to rely only on word frequencies or other simple heuristics, which limits the quality and applicability of the summaries.

This paper proposes a deep‐learning‐based bug report summarization method that leverages sentence significance factors. The factors considered include believability, sentence‐to‐sentence cohesion, and topic association. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state‑of‑the‑art method (BugSum) in terms of precision, recall, and F‑score, and has a wider application scope than the baseline.
